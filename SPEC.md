# QuizMD — Format Specification v0.3

> Part of the **LearnSpec** suite  
> Status: Draft — May 10, 2026  
> Previous version: v0.2

---

## Core Principle: YAML Everywhere

QuizMD uses **YAML as its single configuration syntax**, applied across three progressive and backward-compatible levels. Keys are the same at every level — one mental model to learn.

| Level | Mechanism | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Plain `.quiz.md`, no configuration | Minimal quiz, human-readable |
| 1 | YAML frontmatter at top of file | Global metadata, behaviour, scoring |
| 2 | Per-question ` ```quiz ` fenced block | Per-question overrides (points, timer, hint) |

A Level 0 file is valid at Level 1 and 2. Each level is a strict superset of the previous one.

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Markdown-first** | A `.quiz.md` file is valid Markdown readable in any editor |
| **File-native** | All content lives in files — no database required |
| **YAML everywhere** | One configuration syntax across all three levels |
| **AI-native** | Generatable and consumable by LLMs without specific tooling |
| **LearnSpec-interoperable** | Natively integrates with LearnMD, DiagramMD, MediaMD, and GlossaryMD |

---

## Level 0 — Base Markdown Syntax

### Conventions

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `## Qn` or `## Qn · Title` | Start of a question |
| `- [x]` | Correct answer choice |
| `- [ ]` | Incorrect answer choice |
| `___` | Open-answer field (short answer / fill-in-the-blank) |
| `---` | Question separator (optional when `##` is used) |
| `> text` | Feedback / explanation (shown after submission) |
| `!import ./file.quiz.md` | Include questions from a sub-quiz file |
| `!import ./file.diagram.md` | Include DiagramMD diagram blocks in a question body |
| `!ref ./file.media.md` | Declare a MediaMD context (enables `media:slug` resolution) |
| `!ref ./file.glossary.md` | Declare a GlossaryMD context (enables term highlighting) |
| `$...$` | Inline LaTeX math formula |
| `$$...$$` | Block (display) LaTeX math formula |
| `![alt](media:slug "fallback-url")` | Image via MediaMD with fallback |
| `![alt](url)` | Direct image |

### Question Body

The body of a question is all Markdown content between the `## Qn` heading (and its optional ` ```quiz ` block) and the first answer choice (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) or the `___` marker. The body may contain paragraphs, lists, tables, formulas, images, and diagrams — any valid Markdown.

This mechanism supports **passage-based questions** (reading comprehension, physics problems, legal cases) without any additional syntax.

### Minimal Example

```markdown
# My first quiz

## Q1 · What is the capital of France?

- [ ] London
- [x] Paris
- [ ] Berlin

> Paris has been the capital since the 10th century.

## Q2 · True or false: The Earth is flat.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Q3 · Fill in the blank: The sun is a ___.

**Answer:** star
```

---

## Question Types

### MCQ — Single Correct Answer

One `- [x]` marks the correct choice. All other choices use `- [ ]`.

```markdown
## Q1 · Which composer wrote "The Four Seasons"?

- [ ] Johann Sebastian Bach
- [ ] George Frideric Handel
- [x] Antonio Vivaldi
- [ ] Arcangelo Corelli

> "The Four Seasons" (1725) is a set of four violin concertos by Vivaldi.
```

### Multi-Select — Multiple Correct Answers

Two or more `- [x]` marks indicate multiple correct choices. Players should display checkboxes rather than radio buttons.

```markdown
## Q2 · Which are characteristics of Baroque music?

- [x] Basso continuo
- [x] Terraced dynamics
- [ ] Twelve-tone serialism
- [x] Elaborate ornamentation
- [x] Counterpoint and polyphony
- [ ] Minimalist texture
```

### Open Answer — Fill in the Blank

The `___` marker signals a free-text input field. The expected answer follows on an `**Answer:**` line.

```markdown
## Q3 · Fill in the blank: Bach's 30 keyboard variations are known as the ___ Variations.

**Answer:** Goldberg
```

Multiple blanks in a single question are supported by repeating `___`:

```markdown
## Q4 · Complete: ___ was born in ___, Germany.

**Answer:** Handel | Halle
```

### True / False

A True/False question is an MCQ with exactly two choices labelled `True` and `False`.

### Match Pairs

Associates items from two columns. Declared with `type: match` in the per-question block:

```markdown
## Q5 · Match each composer with their nationality.

```quiz
type: match
points: 4
```

| Composer | Nationality |
|---|---|
| Bach | German |
| Vivaldi | Italian |
| Handel | German |
| Rameau | French |
```

### Order

Asks the learner to sort items into the correct sequence. Declared with `type: order`. The correct order is the order in which items appear in the list:

```markdown
## Q6 · Place these composers in chronological order of birth.

```quiz
type: order
points: 3
```

1. Claudio Monteverdi (1567)
2. Heinrich Schütz (1585)
3. Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632)
4. Henry Purcell (1659)
5. Antonio Vivaldi (1678)
```

---

## Diagrams and Media in Questions

### Diagrams

A question body may contain diagram blocks using **DiagramMD Level 0** fenced block syntax with optional Level 2 attributes (`caption`, `width`, `alt`). The DiagramMD frontmatter (Level 1) is not applicable.

```markdown
## Q7 · What type of circuit is shown below?

```tikz caption:"Circuit diagram" alt:"Series circuit with resistor and capacitor"
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw (0,0) to[R, l=$R$] (2,0) to[C, l=$C$] (4,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

- [x] Series RC circuit
- [ ] Parallel RL circuit
- [ ] Series LC circuit
```

```markdown
## Q8 · What is the best move for White?

```chess caption:"Position after 15.Nf3" alt:"Chessboard — tactical position in the middlegame"
r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8
```

- [x] 16.d5
- [ ] 16.Ne5
- [ ] 16.Bg5
```

For diagrams reused across multiple questions, use `!import ./file.diagram.md`.

### Images via MediaMD

```markdown
!ref ./media-biology.media.md

## Q9 · Which organelle is shown in the image?

![Plant cell diagram](media:plant-cell "https://upload.wikimedia.org/.../plant-cell.svg")

- [x] Chloroplast
- [ ] Mitochondrion
- [ ] Nucleus
```

---

## Feedback Syntax

QuizMD supports four levels of feedback, freely combinable within a single question:

| Syntax | Scope | When displayed |
|---|---|---|
| ` > text` (indented under a choice) | Per-choice | Only when that choice is selected |
| `> [!correct] text` | Global | Only when the answer is correct |
| `> [!incorrect] text` | Global | Only when the answer is incorrect |
| `> text` | Global | Always (general explanation) |

### Display Priority Rules

1. Per-choice feedback is displayed **inline**, below the option, only if the learner selected it.
2. `[!correct]` or `[!incorrect]` appears in the result banner according to the outcome.
3. Global `>` feedback always appears in the result banner, after the targeted feedback.
4. For open-answer questions, only global feedback applies.

---

## The `!import` Directive

Includes questions from another `.quiz.md` file or diagrams from a `.diagram.md` file.

```markdown
!import ./sub-quiz.quiz.md
!import ./diagrams-physics.diagram.md
```

- Questions from the sub-quiz are inserted at the position of the directive
- Questions are renumbered sequentially across the full assembled quiz
- The frontmatter of the sub-quiz is ignored
- Imports are recursive — circular imports are silently skipped
- Missing files are ignored without error

---

## Reveal and Feedback Modes

### `reveal` — Question Display

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `all` (default) | All questions displayed at once |
| `sequential` | Questions revealed one at a time |

### `feedback_mode` — When Corrections Appear

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `immediate` (default) | Correction shown immediately after submission |
| `deferred` | Answers recorded without revealing corrections; results shown at the end |

### Typical Combinations

| `reveal` | `feedback_mode` | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `all` | `immediate` | Practice mode (default) |
| `sequential` | `immediate` | Guided progression |
| `all` | `deferred` | Paper-style exam |
| `sequential` | `deferred` | Exam mode |

---

## Level 1 — YAML Frontmatter

## Level 2 — Per-Question Fenced Block

A ` ```quiz ` block placed immediately after the question heading overrides global parameters for that specific question.

```markdown
## Q3 · Match each element to its geological period.

```quiz
id: geo-match-01
type: match
points: 6
hint: "Think about the geological time scale"
difficulty: hard
tags: [geology, chronology]
bloom: application
```
```

### Per-Question Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Stable unique identifier for this question |
| `type` | enum | `mcq`, `multi`, `open`, `tf`, `match`, or `order` — inferred if absent |
| `points` | int | Points for this question (overrides `scoring.correct`) |
| `timer` | int | Per-question time limit in seconds |
| `hint` | string | Hint shown on demand before submission |
| `difficulty` | enum | `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` |
| `tags` | string[] | Per-question thematic tags |
| `bloom` | enum | Bloom's taxonomy level |
| `depends_on` | string | ID of a question this one is conditional on |

**Type inference:**

| Condition | Inferred type |
|---|---|
| One `- [x]` | `mcq` |
| Two or more `- [x]` | `multi` |
| `___` present | `open` |
| Exactly two choices `True` / `False` | `tf` |

---

## Math Support

LaTeX is auto-detected and rendered via KaTeX. No frontmatter flag required.

| Form | Syntax | Rendering |
|---|---|---|
| Inline | `$E = mc^2$` | Embedded in the line of text |
| Block | `$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x}\,dx = 1$$` | Centred on its own line |

---

## Diagram Support

QuizMD supports **DiagramMD Level 0** fenced blocks in question bodies. See the [DiagramMD spec](./diagrammd-spec.md) for full syntax and supported types.

---

## Partial Scoring

When `partial_scoring: true` (default), **match** and **order** questions award a proportional score.

- **match**: `score = correct_pairs / total_pairs`
- **order**: Uses Kendall's tau (concordant pairs / all pairs)
